                                Taking advantage of the latest technology and data resources, Becket & Lee has developed "System7<span class="SuperScript">SM</span>", which provides a cost effective method to track bankrupt Chapter 7 accounts. Your Chapter 7 accounts are referred to Becket & Lee, where System7<span class='SuperScript'>SM</span> monitors the bankruptcies until they have been closed by the court. The bankruptcies are regularly scrubbed. If an account is identified as an asset case, it is moved from System7<span class='SuperScript'>SM</span> to our core bankruptcy system. There, a Proof of Claim is generated, filed with the court according to local procedures, and the bankruptcy is monitored for activity and payment.

                            <p>
                                In addition, Becket & Lee’s System7<span class="SuperScript">SM</span> provides an electronic update to our clients when a Chapter 7 bankruptcy has been identified as:

                                <li>Discharged and closed by the court</li>
                                <li>Converted to another chapter</li>
                                <li>Becoming an asset case</li>
                            </ul>
